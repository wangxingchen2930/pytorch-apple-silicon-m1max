# PyTorch Tutorial

This project follows the guidance from PyTorch's [official website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html). Revisions are made for running the coed on apple silicon chip locally.

## Goal
- Understand PyTorch's Tensor library and neural networks at a high level.
- Train a small neural network to classify images.

## PyTorch

PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package:
- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs and other accelerators.
- An automatic differentiation library that is useful to implement neural networks.
